Question 1:
    Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?
Answer 1:
    The command line is where you tell the computer things that you want done. This could asking it to start a task or asking it to tell you things it knows.


Question 2:
    List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.

Answer 2:
    commands may differ based on what type of computer your using

    cd: Change Directory
        Changes where you are looking in a computer so the computer knows where to look when you are telling it what to look at without (e.g. giving a street name so you can refer to the places on the street by there number rather than always repeating the street,suburb and so on).
    
    pwd: print directory (the W stands for working)
        tells you where the computer thinks you are looking at/where you are (e.g. it tells you are on a street in whatever suburb in some town)

    mkdir: make a Directory
        Makes a place where you can change your/the computers focus to (e.g. declaring there is a new street)

    ls: Lists
        Tells you what you can see from where you are in the computer (e.g. list the houses on a street).

    dir: directory
        basically the same as ls. might show things in a different manner.

    touch: make a file
        creates a file named what you have given it (e.g. saying there now a house at number 10 and a patch of land of the street )

    rm: remove file
        removes a file such as one you made by touch. wont work for directories (e.g. remove house from a street so its no longer listed. telling a street to be removed in this way would get you a complaint)

    rmdir: remove a directory
        removes a directory and with that (e.g. remove a street and all the houses on that street are also removed)

    echo: repeats what you told it
        command line echos back what you said at it after the echo

    exit: quits the command line
        the command line will stop and clean up anything it was doing.
